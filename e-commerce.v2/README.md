# My Next.js App

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Structure

The project is structured using the atomic design methodology. Components are divided into atoms, molecules, and organisms.

- `src/components/atoms`: This directory contains the smallest building blocks of the application. These components do not have any dependencies on other components.

- `src/components/molecules`: This directory contains components that are a combination of several atoms.

- `src/components/organisms`: This directory contains relatively complex components composed of several molecules and/or atoms.
